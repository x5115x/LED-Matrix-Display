# LED-Matrix-Display
Customized LED Matrix Display in Processing

It is used for simulate LED interactive device in Processing Language.
Especially for those multi-LED strips connection as a single LED strip situation.

The main idea of this algorithm is in 3 steps:
Step 1: Set N x N LED Matrix
Step 2: Use an extra array to storge LED strip length for each LED strip.
Step 3: Set the 1st LED position for every LED strip with the former extra array.
Step 4: Use for loop set rest LEDs' position for every LED strip.

It's a very simple and basic algorithm for doing this job.
You can play it with different parameters.
